•	Conducted a deep-dive audit of DMV Amazon Consulting’s digital presence-highlighting deficient SEO for key terms like “immigration help Silver Spring,” a lack of active social media, no online appointment scheduling, UI/UX improvement required with slow page load (4.2 s).
•	Developed a brand refresh roadmap emphasizing bilingual, culturally attuned messaging that positioned DMV as a trusted, digital-first alternative for immigrant entrepreneurs in the DMV area—a strategic differentiation against TurboTax and H&R Block.
•	Recommended high-impact Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ad campaigns and TikTok initiatives, such as a viral #TAXES vs EXES video, to drive brand awareness, attract younger audiences, and enhance social engagement, increasing followers by +50% in 3 months.
•	Designed a comprehensive email marketing and automation sequence using CRM tools: welcome, reminder, confirmation, and post-service emails aimed to drive +20% conversion (quote → appointment), improve open rates (target: 25%), and encourage return visits.
•	Proposed an online appointment booking interface, downloadable service checklists, transparent pricing, and automated WhatsApp/email reminders to streamline customer journey, from awareness to advocacy-enhancing both convenience and trust.
•	Built a referral and review generation program: incentivize clients to refer peers and leave reviews, aiming to drive +20% referral-based site visits per month and cement reputation within the community.
•	Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with business objectives: +1,000 website visitors and +50% social media followers in 3 months; +100 U35 new customers in 6 months; +20% client retention over 12 months.
