Devised a social media and digital marketing plan for DMV Amazon Consulting, a Maryland-based multi-service firm serving immigrant communities, especially Ethiopians. It highlights rising market demand, customer pain points (outdated website, low online presence, no booking system, unclear pricing), and competitive gaps with national players like TurboTax. Strategies include a brand refresh, strong SEO, local search, email automation, viral social media campaigns, and referral programs. Target personas—Businessman Binyam (B2B) and Freelancer Freda (B2C)—guide tailored messaging. Measurable goals cover website traffic, social followers, new clients, and retention. The plan details phased budgets, KPIs, and recommended tools for execution.
